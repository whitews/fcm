For Developers of fcm:
to run the python modules in the source tree (not the installed library) a little setup is needed.
provide a link to the src folder named fcm somewhere in the python path.

eg:
> mkdir ~/MyPython
> cd ~/MyPython
> ln -s <path to fcm>/src fcm

and then add ~/MyPython/ to the python path and scripts should run fine from the source tree then.
