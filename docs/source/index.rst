The *fcm* flow cytometry analysis library
#########################################

:py:mod:`fcm` is a Python library to perform exploratory data analysis and batch processing
for flow cytometry data. It provides methods for doing loading fcs data and performing
spectral compensation and standard log, and loglike transformations.  It supports 
traditional flow analysis using gating (standard polygon, quadrant, threshold and 
interval gates) and model based analysis (k-means and Dirichlet processes mixture models).
